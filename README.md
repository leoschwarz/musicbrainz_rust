# MusicBrainz-Rust
The aim of this project is to provide an ergonomic client for the [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) music database.
Specifically this is a client for the version 2 of the [MusicBrainz XML web service](https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/Development/XML_Web_Service/Version_2).

## Status
The library is an early stage so no stability guarantees are made yet. Especially testing and documentation will require more work before a proper release.
